# Concordia-DS---Regression-Project
In this project you will be able to walkthrough the process of creating multiple regression models out of a cvs file.
Here we will mainly see the data of the housing rental in Canada.
If we go step by step, we will first start with analysing the data, making sure we understand everything and preparing it for our models.
We will then proceed with the feature engineering a strat with the regression models we try a few types of models such as  Multilinear Regression, Polynominal Regression, Ridge Regression, Ridge CV and Lasso CV.
